### Anomaly Detection & Gaussian Model (ADGM)
</br>
</br>

Anomaly detection systems yields use cases in many use cases and domains. This mini project implements such a system from scratch for theoretical understanding. Please visit [anomalyDetection.ipynb (colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qQc0GQi--4kCBnAHYNxAM_j17VB7lpW_?usp=sharing) for details on implementation.
</br>
</br>

Note that compaired to supervised learning/classification algorithms, an anomaly detection algorithm is more **preferable** in several cases, i.e.:
- the number of positive examples (i.e. the cases of anomalies) are very small, usually between 0 ~ 20
- many different types of positive classes (i.e. labels of anomalies) that are hard(er) for supervised learning algorithms to learn from
- future anomalies may be potentially deviate from training examples significantly

_This project is partially implemented leveraging resources provided by the original Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng in collaboration with the University of Stanford._
